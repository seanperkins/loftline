# One-time setup of signing for .github/workflows/release.yml. Run it yourself: it uses your keychain export and your
# GitHub login, and it writes to GitHub.
#
#   1. Keychain Access -> login keychain -> "My Certificates" -> select
#      "Developer ID Application: Sean Perkins (HH3SJBAS42)" (the one with a private key, not another team's item)
#      -> File > Export Items... -> Personal Information Exchange (.p12), with any new password.
#   2. scripts/configure-release-ci.sh /path/to/exported.p12
#
# The signing p12 is re-wrapped under a freshly generated passphrase, checked to be a Developer ID identity WITH its
# private key, and only then pushed to a PRIVATE vault repo. The runner reads the vault with a read-only deploy key made
# new on every run. Notarisation uses the App Store Connect API key (checked-in id and issuer; only the .p8 is secret).
#
# Adapted from rootkit-game's tools/configure_macos_ci.sh. Do NOT run that one for LoftLine: it hard-codes
# seanperkins/rootkit-macos-certs and would re-wrap the p12 there, breaking rootkit-game's MACOS_CERT_PASSWORD.
#
# Variables: REPO (default seanperkins/loftline), VAULT (default seanperkins/loftline-macos-certs) and ASC_KEY_ID
# (default 4XBH56T7RS), which must match what release.yml uses (the script refuses anything else), MACOS_IDENTITY (default
# the Developer ID above; the p12 must contain it), ASC_KEY_FILE (default ~/.appstoreconnect/private_keys/AuthKey_<id>.p8)
# and OPENSSL (an OpenSSL 3.x binary).
